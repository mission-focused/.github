# Mission Focused Developers

This space is meant to foster collaboration between the different teams involved in the development of the mission. The mission being all aspects of regulated and critical environments and those that they serve. This may be Utilities, Transportation, Healthcare, and Education. It may also be capabilities delivered to warfighter organizations.

## Community

We're here to solve problems and build better systems and capabilities that improve the lives of others. We don't bike-shed on the minutia and instead focus our efforts to build a better future. That may be a capability delivered today that fills a gap in a secure or operational system with a focus on delivery at the speed of relevance and continuing to build/deliver/support enhanced capabilities in rapid succession. 

We're not alone and there are many like us in the pursuit of development for the sake of a better humanity. As such as have a responsibility to collaborate and share knowledge and experiences. Find common problems and build solutions in the open to solve for them. 

## Collaboration

How can we accomplish this?

Collaboration; we can collect stories of Mission Focused Development to aid in the discovery and recruitment of others who wish to join our cause. We can collaborate and build tools that focus on solving problems across the mission domains. Identifying and cataloging capabilities that must be solved for in order to make the full lifecycle of a critical system stronger and more resilient to build in less time.
